If you fork someone else's github repository you 
can now freely modify the code copy which can then
be cloned in a local repository to be changed
and remerged, and eventually you can make a pull 
request to suggest to the owner to change the 
original version with the forked changes you made
in a pull request as you do not have permissions
to change the original, but you may suggest to the
owner(s) any ideas that they can review and possibly
implement to the original. If the pull request is
approved by the owner they merge the two together
and commit the new changes.

Use github to fork someone else's code to make changes
that you find beneficial and send these changes as a
pull request to see if the creator agrees then if they
find your changes good, your changes will be merged.
